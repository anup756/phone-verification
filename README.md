![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anup756/phone-verification/master/images/twilio-logo-red.png)

Things you need:

1. Twilio Account SID
2. Twilio Authentication Token
3. Twilio Number
4. Twilio Application SID (Optional)
5. Twilio Agent Number (Optional)

For verification, we will generate 7 digit random number (unique) and once verified, add that number to the user created. This step is after the user creates an account and when the account is still locked.
